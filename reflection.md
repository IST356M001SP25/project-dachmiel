Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

In this project I got more experience working with APIs, data transformation using pandas, and building  visualizations using Streamlit and Plotly. First, I was able to fetch JSON data from a public API (CollegeFootballData API). Then I had to clean and transform it into a structured format and then use pivot tables to prep the data for analysis. I also became more comfortable using Streamlit components like selectbox, slider, and button to create a dynamic UI.

One challenge I faced during this project was understanding how to manage the raw API data, which included nested dictionaries and categorical stats like "YDS", "COMPLETIONS", and "ATT". It took me some time to figure out how to filter the data by statType and use pivot tables. From this, I learned the importance of reading and understanding the data you are working with before attempting to manipulate it.
